        <h3>A plant based, vegan deliciousness! (Yummy!)</h3>
        <p>The new generation of vegan meat alternatives, such as Impossible and Beyond,
            are at their best when still medium-rare and juicy.
            Flipping the patties frequently as they cook ensures an evenly cooked interior and good flavor development on the exterior.
            To make the burgers vegetarian, feel free to use any good melting cheese, such as American,
            Cheddar or Swiss, but to make them strictly vegan, be sure to look for vegan burger buns,
            as standard supermarket burger buns frequently contain milk or other dairy products.</p>
        <ul>Ingredients (4 burgers):</ul>
        <li>1 pound vegan ground meat, such as Impossible or Beyond</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 slices vegan cheese, such as Cheddar-style</li>
        <li>4 vegan hamburger buns, lightly toasted Toppings and condiments, to taste</li>
